      <p class="parrafobio"><b> Krishna Valdez Ramírez (Krishna VR)</b> (May 20 1999, México)
        is a young photographer also well-known by her creative and conceptual works of art. Krishna
        demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, creating nonexistent characters
        that usually just existed in her imagination and now she says that melancholic and sad moments
        are the ‘most inspiring moments is her life’, there it comes the creation of ‘Ofelia’ ,one of
         her favorite artworks created in 2015 when she was feeling sad about the amount of things
         happening in her life and got inspired with a friend that also loves art.</p>
         <p class="parrafobio1">
About 5 years ago she took her first picture with a professional camera and he felt that photography could be a way to express herself with her own body as she got inspiration from other conceptual photographers on the web. She explains that we can’t create without an idea that comes from the deepest parts of our heart and feelings,
ideas come but incomplete when you don’t really feel inspired about what you are doing.
